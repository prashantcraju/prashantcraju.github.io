        <p><font color="white">I am fascinated by the human brain, and I have a strong interest in learning the mathematics behind its mechanisms and in applying them to artificial intelligence. I am a student at <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>, studying Computer Science, Physics, and Applied Mathematics and doing academic research in the fields of artificial intelligence and theoretical neuroscience. I previously spent time in Palo Alto, where I help launch multiple different startups. Find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prashantcraju/">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="mailto:rajuprashant@gmail.com?Subject=Hello%20again" target="_top">email me.</font></a></p>
