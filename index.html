        <p><font color="white">I am fascinated by the human brain, and I am driven to learn the mathematics behind its mechanisms and to apply them to artificial intelligence. I am a student at <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>, studying Computer Science, Physics, and Applied Mathematics and doing academic research in the fields of artificial intelligence and theoretical neuroscience. I previously spent time in Palo Alto, where I help launch multiple different startups.
